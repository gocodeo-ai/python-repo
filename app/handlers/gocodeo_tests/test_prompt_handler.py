### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: We import the necessary modules including `pytest`, `unittest.mock`, and the classes from your code.

2. **Sample Code**: A sample code snippet (`sample_code`) is provided to be used in the tests.

3. **Fixtures**: For each handler class (`PromptHandler`, `GeminiPromptHandler`, `GPTPromptHandler`, `AnthropicPromptHandler`), we define a fixture that mocks the class and its dependencies. The `MagicMock` is used to create mock objects for the model and other attributes.

4. **Test Cases**: We define test functions that utilize the fixtures. Each test can assert certain behaviors or states of the mocked instances.

5. **Assertions**: In the example test case `test_prompt_handler_initialization`, we check that the `initialize_model` method correctly sets the language, framework, and code attributes.

You can expand the test cases for each specific handler class based on the methods and expected behaviors in your implementation.
